# Flowcharts-in-programming
Flowcharts are diagrams to represent solutions of problems.
We can do so by- 
1. dividing the solution in small parts
2.  logically arranging the parts

Components of flowcharts-
1. Start/exit- written within oval
2. Input/output- written within parallelogram
3. Processes- written within rectangles
4. Decisions- written within diamonds
5. Arrows- used to connect the shapes
